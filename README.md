# Multiopt_VoI_SI

This repository contains the codebase for "Multi-objective value of information assessment using stochastic programming: addressing uncertainty in site index determination" manuscript

The following files are contained in this directory: 
README.md -- brief instructions to run the analysis.
combined_plots.html -- the interactive 3D figures from the manuscript, can be viewed via: https://olhanahorna.github.io/Multiopt_VoI_SI/combined_plots.html
Input for optimization -- contains files that were used as input for the optimization model. The files are the output of the forest simulator Gaya 2.0
Python codes -- contains the python scripts:
    2024-03-06_optimization_model.ipynb  -- the script used to generate uncertainty scenarios, payoff tables and run the optimization model
    2024-06-04_applied_reference.ipynb -- the script used to apply the decision from other approaches to the reference dataset
